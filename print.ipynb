      "Okay, let's try to figure out how many ways we can choose three collinear points from this grid. First, I need to visualize the grid. The problem says it's a grid of points, and from the image description, it looks like a 4x4 grid. Wait, let me confirm. The user mentioned \"a grid\" with dots, and the image shows four rows and four columns, right? Let me check: each row has four dots, so 4 rows, 4 columns. So total points are 4x4=16 points.\n",

      "Now, the problem is to find all sets of three collinear points. So, we need to count all lines that have at least three points, and then for each such line, count the number of ways to choose three points from them. But wait, actually, since the problem says \"we take three points from the grid so that they were collinear,\" it's about all possible triples of collinear points, regardless of the line's orientation. So we need to consider all straight lines that pass through at least three points in the grid, and for each such line, compute the number of combinations of three points on it, then sum them up.\n",

    "print(\"Okay, let's try to figure out how many ways we can choose three collinear points from this grid. First, I need to visualize the grid. The problem says it's a grid of points, and from the image description, it looks like a 4x4 grid. Wait, let me confirm. The user mentioned \\\"a grid\\\" with dots, and the image shows four rows and four columns, right? Let me check: each row has four dots, so 4 rows, 4 columns. So total points are 4x4=16 points.\\n\\nNow, the problem is to find all sets of three collinear points. So, we need to count all lines that have at least three points, and then for each such line, count the number of ways to choose three points from them. But wait, actually, since the problem says \\\"we take three points from the grid so that they were collinear,\\\" it's about all possible triples of collinear points, regardless of the line's orientation. So we need to consider all straight lines that pass through at least three points in the grid, and for each such line, compute the number of combinations of three points on it, then sum them up.\\n\\nFirst, let's recall that in a grid, lines can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. Also, there might be other lines with different slopes, like 1/2, 2/1, etc. So we need to categorize all possible lines with at least three points.\\n\\nStarting with horizontal lines. In a 4x4 grid, horizontal lines have 4 points each. How many horizontal lines are there? 4 rows. So each horizontal line has 4 points. The number of ways to choose three points from a line of 4 is C(4,3)=4. So for each horizontal line, there are 4 combinations. Since there are 4 horizontal lines, total horizontal triples: 4*4=16.\\n\\nVertical lines: Similarly, each column has 4 points. There are 4 columns. Each column has C(4,3)=4. So 4*4=16 vertical triples.\\n\\nNow, diagonal lines. Let's consider the main diagonals. The main diagonals (top-left to bottom-right) have 4 points each. For example, the top-left to bottom-right diagonal: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). Similarly, the other main diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1). Each of these has 4 points. So each main diagonal has C(4,3)=4 triples. So 2 main diagonals, each contributing 4, so 2*4=8.\\n\\nBut wait, are there other diagonals with more than 4 points? Wait, in a 4x4 grid, the diagonals with slope 1 have length 4, but there are also diagonals with different slopes. For example, diagonals with slope 2 (like going 2 steps right and 1 step up), but in a 4x4 grid, let's see.\\n\\nWait, let's think about the grid coordinates. Let's assume the grid is from (1,1) to (4,4). So points are (i,j) where i and j are from 1 to 4.\\n\\nFirst, horizontal lines: y = constant. For each y = 1,2,3,4, there are 4 points. So C(4,3)=4 per line. 4 lines * 4 = 16.\\n\\nVertical lines: x = constant. For each x = 1,2,3,4, 4 points. C(4,3)=4 per line. 4*4=16.\\n\\nNow, diagonals with slope 1: these are the lines where j = i + c for some c. Let's see:\\n\\nFor c = -1: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) [length 4]\\n\\nc = 0: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) [length 3]\\n\\nc = -2: (1,3), (2,4) [length 2]\\n\\nWait, no, wait. Wait, the slope is 1, so the difference in j over i is 1. So the length of the diagonal with slope 1 is the number of points. For a 4x4 grid, the diagonals with slope 1 have lengths:\\n\\nStarting from the top-left, going down-right:\\n\\n(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — length 4\\n\\n(1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — length 3\\n\\n(1,3), (2,4) — length 2\\n\\n(2,1), (3,2), (4,3) — but wait, (2,1) is a valid point, (3,2), (4,3) — length 3\\n\\nWait, maybe I need to list all diagonals with slope 1.\\n\\nWait, actually, for slope 1, the diagonals are determined by their starting point (i,j) such that i + j = constant. Let's check:\\n\\nFor i + j = 2: (1,1) — length 1\\n\\ni + j = 3: (1,2), (2,1) — length 2\\n\\ni + j = 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) — length 3\\n\\ni + j = 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) — length 4\\n\\ni + j = 6: (2,4), (3,3), (4,2) — length 3\\n\\ni + j = 7: (3,4), (4,3) — length 2\\n\\ni + j = 8: (4,4) — length 1\\n\\nAh, right. So the diagonals with slope 1 have lengths:\\n\\nLength 1: 2 diagonals (i+j=2, i+j=8)\\n\\nLength 2: 2 diagonals (i+j=3, i+j=7)\\n\\nLength 3: 2 diagonals (i+j=4, i+j=6)\\n\\nLength 4: 1 diagonal (i+j=5)\\n\\nWait, no, actually, for i + j = 5, there are 4 points: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1). Similarly, i + j = 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) — 3 points. i + j = 6: (2,4), (3,3), (4,2) — 3 points. i + j = 7: (3,4), (4,3) — 2 points. i + j = 8: (4,4) — 1 point. i + j = 2: (1,1), (2,1)? Wait no, i + j = 2: (1,1) only. Wait, because i and j are from 1 to 4. So i + j = 2: (1,1) only. i + j = 3: (1,2), (2,1) — 2 points. i + j = 4: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) — 3 points. i + j = 5: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) — 4 points. i + j = 6: (2,4), (3,3), (4,2) — 3 points. i + j = 7: (3,4), (4,3) — 2 points. i + j = 8: (4,4) — 1 point.\\n\\nYes, that's correct. So for slope 1, the diagonals have lengths 1,2,3,4.\\n\\nSo for each diagonal with length n, the number of triples is C(n,3). So for length 4: C(4,3)=4. Length 3: C(3,3)=1. Length 2: C(2,3)=0. Length 1: 0.\\n\\nSo how many diagonals with length 4? There's 1 (i+j=5). The number of such diagonals is 1.\\n\\nHow many diagonals with length 3? i+j=4 and i+j=6. So 2 diagonals. Each has C(3,3)=1 triple. So 2*1=2.\\n\\nHow many diagonals with length 2? i+j=3 and i+j=7: 2 diagonals. Each has C(2,3)=0. So 0.\\n\\nHow many diagonals with length 1? i+j=2 and i+j=8: 2 diagonals. 0.\\n\\nSo total slope 1 diagonals: 1*4 + 2*1 = 4 + 2 = 6 triples.\\n\\nWait, but hold on, is that all? Wait, no. Wait, the problem is that the grid is 4x4, so there are also diagonals with slope -1, which is the same as slope 1 but in the opposite direction. Wait, no, slope -1 is j = -i + c. Let's check.\\n\\nSlope -1: i - j = constant. Let's see:\\n\\ni - j = 0: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — length 4 (same as slope 1)\\n\\ni - j = 1: (2,1), (3,2), (4,3) — length 3\\n\\ni - j = 2: (3,1), (4,2) — length 2\\n\\ni - j = 3: (4,1) — length 1\\n\\nWait, no, let's check:\\n\\ni - j = 1: (2,1), (3,2), (4,3) — 3 points.\\n\\ni - j = 2: (3,1), (4,2) — 2 points.\\n\\ni - j = 3: (4,1) — 1 point.\\n\\ni - j = 0: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — 4 points.\\n\\nWait, but actually, slope -1 would be j = -i + c, so c = i + j. Wait, same as i - j = constant. So for i - j = 1: (1,0) invalid, so (2,1), (3,2), (4,3). But i and j start at 1, so j = i - 1. So i >= 2.\\n\\nSimilarly, i - j = 2: (3,1), (4,2). i >= 3.\\n\\ni - j = 3: (4,1). i >= 4.\\n\\nSo the diagonals with slope -1 have lengths:\\n\\nLength 4: 1 diagonal (i - j = 0)\\n\\nLength 3: 1 diagonal (i - j = 1)\\n\\nLength 2: 1 diagonal (i - j = 2)\\n\\nLength 1: 1 diagonal (i - j = 3)\\n\\nWait, no:\\n\\ni - j = 0: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — 4 points.\\n\\ni - j = 1: (2,1), (3,2), (4,3) — 3 points.\\n\\ni - j = 2: (3,1), (4,2) — 2 points.\\n\\ni - j = 3: (4,1) — 1 point.\\n\\ni - j = -1: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — 3 points.\\n\\nWait, i - j = -1: i = j + 1. So (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — 3 points.\\n\\ni - j = -2: (1,3), (2,4) — 2 points.\\n\\ni - j = -3: (1,4) — 1 point.\\n\\nSo slope -1 diagonals:\\n\\nLength 4: 1 diagonal (i - j = 0)\\n\\nLength 3: 2 diagonals (i - j = 1, i - j = -1)\\n\\nLength 2: 1 diagonal (i - j = 2, i - j = -2)\\n\\nLength 1: 1 diagonal (i - j = 3, i - j = -3)\\n\\nWait, let's count:\\n\\ni - j = 0: 4 points (length 4)\\n\\ni - j = 1: 3 points (length 3)\\n\\ni - j = 2: 2 points (length 2)\\n\\ni - j = 3: 1 point (length 1)\\n\\ni - j = -1: 3 points (length 3)\\n\\ni - j = -2: 2 points (length 2)\\n\\ni - j = -3: 1 point (length 1)\\n\\nSo total slope -1 diagonals:\\n\\nLength 4: 1\\n\\nLength 3: 2\\n\\nLength 2: 2\\n\\nLength 1: 2\\n\\nWait, no, wait:\\n\\ni - j = 0: 4 points\\n\\ni - j = 1: 3 points\\n\\ni - j = 2: 2 points\\n\\ni - j = 3: 1 point\\n\\ni - j = -1: 3 points\\n\\ni - j = -2: 2 points\\n\\ni - j = -3: 1 point\\n\\nSo total diagonals with slope -1: 8 diagonals.\\n\\nWait, but how many diagonals are there? For slope -1, the number of diagonals is 2*4 - 1 = 7? Wait, no. In a grid of m x n, the number of diagonals with slope 1 is (m + n - 2) or something. Wait, maybe better to think in terms of the grid.\\n\\nWait, for a 4x4 grid, the number of diagonals with slope 1 (i + j = constant) is 8 (since for i from 1 to 4, j = 5 - i, so for i=1, j=4; i=2, j=3; i=3, j=2; i=4, j=1. Wait, no, i + j = 5 is the main diagonal, which has 4 points. Then i + j = 4, 6, etc. Wait, earlier we saw that i + j = 4 has 3 points, i + j = 5 has 4 points, i + j = 6 has 3 points, i + j = 7 has 2 points, i + j = 8 has 1 point. So that's 7 diagonals for slope 1.\\n\\nSimilarly, for slope -1 (i - j = constant), there are also 7 diagonals.\\n\\nWait, let's list them for slope -1:\\n\\ni - j = 0: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — 4 points\\n\\ni - j = 1: (2,1), (3,2), (4,3) — 3 points\\n\\ni - j = 2: (3,1), (4,2) — 2 points\\n\\ni - j = 3: (4,1) — 1 point\\n\\ni - j = -1: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — 3 points\\n\\ni - j = -2: (1,3), (2,4) — 2 points\\n\\ni - j = -3: (1,4) — 1 point\\n\\nSo that's 7 diagonals for slope -1.\\n\\nSo for slope -1, the diagonals have lengths 4,3,2,1,3,2,1.\\n\\nSo the number of triples:\\n\\nLength 4: C(4,3)=4\\n\\nLength 3: C(3,3)=1\\n\\nLength 2: 0\\n\\nLength 1: 0\\n\\nSo for slope -1:\\n\\n4 (length 4) + 2 (length 3) = 4 + 2 = 6 triples.\\n\\nWait, but earlier for slope 1, we had:\\n\\ni + j = 5: 4 points (length 4), C(4,3)=4\\n\\ni + j = 4: 3 points, C(3,3)=1\\n\\ni + j = 6: 3 points, C(3,3)=1\\n\\ni + j = 3: 2 points, 0\\n\\ni + j = 7: 2 points, 0\\n\\ni + j = 2: 1 point, 0\\n\\ni + j = 8: 1 point, 0\\n\\nSo slope 1 has 1 diagonal with length 4, 2 diagonals with length 3, and 0 for others. So total triples: 1*4 + 2*1 = 6.\\n\\nSimilarly, slope -1 has 1 diagonal with length 4, 2 diagonals with length 3, so 6 triples.\\n\\nWait, but wait, for slope -1, i + j = 5 is the same as i - j = 5? No, i + j = 5 is slope 1, i - j = 5 is slope -1.\\n\\nWait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let's list all possible lines with at least three points.\\n\\nFirst, horizontal and vertical lines: 4 rows, 4 columns. Each has 4 points. So C(4,3)=4 per line. 4*4=16.\\n\\nVertical lines: same as horizontal. 16.\\n\\nNow, diagonal lines with slope 1: as above, for i + j = k, k=2 to 8.\\n\\nk=2: 1 point\\n\\nk=3: 2 points\\n\\nk=4: 3 points\\n\\nk=5: 4 points\\n\\nk=6: 3 points\\n\\nk=7: 2 points\\n\\nk=8: 1 point\\n\\nSo for k=5: C(4,3)=4\\n\\nk=4: C(3,3)=1\\n\\nk=6: C(3,3)=1\\n\\nTotal for slope 1: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\\n\\nSimilarly, slope -1: i - j = k.\\n\\nk=0: 4 points\\n\\nk=1: 3 points\\n\\nk=2: 2 points\\n\\nk=3: 1 point\\n\\nk=-1: 3 points\\n\\nk=-2: 2 points\\n\\nk=-3: 1 point\\n\\nSo k=0: 4 points, C(4,3)=4\\n\\nk=1: 3 points, 1\\n\\nk=-1: 3 points, 1\\n\\nk=2: 2 points, 0\\n\\nk=-2: 2 points, 0\\n\\nTotal for slope -1: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.\\n\\nWait, but what about other slopes? For example, slope 2, which is j = 2i - 1 or something.\\n\\nLet's consider slope 1/2. For example, lines where j = (i/2) + c.\\n\\nIn a 4x4 grid, let's see: for example, starting at (1,1), going to (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — that's slope 1. What about slope 1/2? Let's see:\\n\\nTake (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 1/2: starting at (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — no, that's slope 1.\\n\\nWait, let's take a line with slope 1/2. For example, (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) is slope 1. Wait, maybe another line: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — slope 1. Wait, slope 1.\\n\\nWait, slope 1/2: j = i/2 + c. Let's take c=1: j = 0.5i + 1. So for i=2, j=1.5, invalid. i=4, j=3. So (4,3) is a point. Wait, (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — slope 1. Wait, maybe slope 1/2 would be like (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — no, that's slope 1.\\n\\nWait, perhaps slope 2: j = 2i - 1. For example, (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) — but 5 is invalid. Wait, (1,1), (2,3) — no, that's 2 points. Wait, (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) invalid. Maybe (1,2), (2,4) — slope 2 (since (2-1)/(4-2)=1/2, so slope 1/2). Wait, (1,2), (2,4) — that's a line with slope 1/2. But does it have three points? (1,2), (2,4), and maybe (3,6)? No, 6 is invalid. So only two points. So that's not a valid line.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 2: j = 2i - 1. Let's see (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) — invalid. (1,3), (2,5) — invalid. So maybe no three points.\\n\\nWait, another slope: slope 1/3. Let's see (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1. Wait, maybe (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — slope 1. How about (1,3), (2,4) — slope 1. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, let's think of other diagonals. For example, in a 4x4 grid, there are also lines that are not axis-aligned or slope 1 or -1.\\n\\nFor example, a line with slope 2: let's check (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) — invalid. (1,2), (2,4) — only two points. (1,3), (2,5) invalid. So no.\\n\\nWait, slope 1/2: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1. (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — slope 1. (1,3), (2,4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 2: (1,1), (3,3), (5,5) — invalid. (2,1), (4,3) — slope 2 (from (2,1) to (4,3): (4-2)/(3-1)=2/2=1, slope 1. Wait, no.\\n\\nWait, perhaps slope 2: (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) — slope -1. Wait, that's the other diagonal.\\n\\nWait, maybe I need to consider all possible lines with at least three points in the grid.\\n\\nLet's list all possible lines with slope 1/2, 2/1, etc.\\n\\nFirst, slope 1/2: lines where the difference in y is 1 and x is 2. So for example, (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) is slope 1. Wait, slope 1/2 would be (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — no, that's slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, slope 1/2: let's see. For example, (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1. (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) invalid. (1,2), (2,4) — slope 2 (since (4-2)/(2-1)=2/1=2). Wait, slope 2 is (Δy)/(Δx)=2. So for Δx=1, Δy=2.\\n\\nSo the line with slope 2 would be (i,j) where j = 2i + c. Let's see:\\n\\nFor i=1, j=2*1 + c = 2 + c. To have j between 1 and 4: c= -1 gives j=1, so (1,1). Then i=2, j=2*2 + c=4 + c=4 + (-1)=3, so (2,3). i=3, j=6 + c=6 -1=5 invalid. So only two points: (1,1), (2,3).\\n\\nSimilarly, i=1, j=1; i=2, j=3; i=3, j=5 invalid. So no three points.\\n\\nAnother slope: slope 1/3. Let's see (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1. (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — slope 1. (1,3), (2,4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 2/1: (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) invalid. (1,2), (2,4) — slope 2. Wait, (1,2), (2,4) — two points. (1,3), (2,5) invalid. So no three points.\\n\\nWait, slope 3/1: (1,1), (2,4) — slope 3 (Δy=3, Δx=1). (1,1), (2,4), (3,7) invalid. So only two points.\\n\\nWait, slope 1/4: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1. (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) — horizontal. Hmm.\\n\\nWait, maybe there are other lines with different slopes. Let's consider lines with slope 2/3.\\n\\nFor example, starting at (1,1), then (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4) — slope 1. Starting at (1,2), (2, 3), (3, 4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe a line with slope 2/3: (1,1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4) — slope 1. (1,2), (2, 3), (3, 4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe I need to think of lines that are not axis-aligned or slope 1/-1.\\n\\nWait, for example, a line with slope 1/2: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1. Wait, no.\\n\\nWait, let's take an example: (1,2), (2,4), (3,6) — invalid. So no.\\n\\nWait, maybe (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) invalid. (1,2), (2,4), (3,6) invalid.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 2: (1,1), (2,3) — two points. (2,1), (3,3) — two points. (3,1), (4,3) — two points. Not enough.\\n\\nWait, perhaps slope 1/2 is not giving us any lines with three points.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 2/1: (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) invalid. (1,2), (2,4) — two points. (2,1), (3,3), (4,5) invalid.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 3/1: (1,1), (2,4) — two points. (2,1), (3,4) — two points. (3,1), (4,4) — two points.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 1/3: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1. (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe there are lines with slope 2/1 that have three points. Let's see:\\n\\nTake (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) — invalid.\\n\\n(1,2), (2,4), (3,6) — invalid.\\n\\n(1,3), (2,5) — invalid.\\n\\n(1,4), (2,6) — invalid.\\n\\n(2,1), (3,3), (4,5) — invalid.\\n\\n(2,2), (3,4), (4,6) — invalid.\\n\\n(3,1), (4,3) — two points.\\n\\n(3,2), (4,4) — two points.\\n\\n(4,1), (5,3) — invalid.\\n\\nSo no three points for slope 2/1.\\n\\nWait, what about slope 3/2? Let's see (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1. (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) — invalid.\\n\\nWait, perhaps slope 2/1 is not possible here.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 1/2: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe there's another line with slope 1/2. Let's see (1,3), (2,4), (3,5) invalid. (1,4), (2,5) invalid.\\n\\nWait, perhaps slope 1/2 is not giving us any lines with three points.\\n\\nWait, let's think of another slope: slope 3/1.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 1/4: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe there are lines with slope 2/3. Let's take (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1. (1,2), (2,3), (3,4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe (1,1), (2,3), (3,5) invalid.\\n\\nWait, maybe (1,2), (2,4), (3,6) invalid.\\n\\nWait, maybe slope 3/2: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4) — slope 1.\\n\\nWait, maybe there are no lines with slopes other than 1, -1, and maybe some other slopes.\\n\\nWait, let's check a different approach. In a grid of size m x n, the number of collinear triples can be calculated by considering all lines with at least three points, and for each such line, compute C(k,3) where k is the number of points.\\n\\nFor a 4x4 grid, let's list all possible lines:\\n\\nHorizontal lines: 4 rows, 4 points each. C(4,3)=4 per line. Total: 4*4=16.\\n\\nVertical lines: 4 columns, 4 points each. C(4,3)=4 per line. Total: 4*4=16.\\n\\nDiagonals with slope 1 (i + j = constant):\\n\\nAs we saw, the lengths are:\\n\\nk=2: 1 point\\n\\nk=3: 2 points\\n\\nk=4: 3 points\\n\\nk=5: 4 points\\n\\nk=6: 3 points\\n\\nk=7: 2 points\\n\\nk=8: 1 point\\n\\nSo the diagonals with length 4: 1 (k=5). C(4,3)=4.\\n\\nLength 3: 2 diagonals (k=4 and k=6). C(3,3)=1 each. So 2*1=2.\\n\\nTotal slope 1: 4 + 2 = 6.\\n\\nDiagonals with slope -1 (i - j = constant):\\n\\nLengths:\\n\\nk=0: 4 points (i - j = 0)\\n\\nk=1: 3 points (i - j = 1)\\n\\nk=2: 2 points (i - j = 2)\\n\\nk=3: 1 point (i - j = 3)\\n\\nk=-1: 3 points (i - j = -1)\\n\\nk=-2: 2 points (i - j = -2)\\n\\nk=-3: 1 point (i - j = -3)\\n\\nSo same as slope 1, but for slope -1.\\n\\nLength 4: 1 diagonal (k=0). C(4,3)=4.\\n\\nLength 3: 2 diagonals (k=1 and k=-1). C(3,3)=1 each.
